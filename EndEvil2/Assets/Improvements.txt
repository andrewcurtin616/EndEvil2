	Improvements I want
-Bullet hit point specific animations for zombies, maybe three for each point 'hit,stagger,death'
	on arms legs body and head, total=18 anims
-More enemy behaviors instead of one script for all, different stats too
-More guns, different damage numbers for each and more firing types
-Grenade types: frag grenade, soul grenade (halo plasma sticky), distraction device
-Temporary weapon powerups or limited ammo types:
	HellFire(damage over time), BoneChill(slow down), SoulSteal(electric arc)
-Better weapon inventory
-Better script organization with handlers and helpers
-Better UI formatting
-More player controls, also add a stamina bar
-Melee with slight knock back
-Accuracy for guns, changing based on movement and aiming, with a resizing crosshair to indicate
-Better level layouts
-Full adventure through the town with area objectives

*Look for ways to demonstrate programming patterns
*Could focus on just zombies
*Some of these changes are big, like the hit point specific animations, but more fun
